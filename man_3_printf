.SH Return Value
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printe(excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; an conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision an an optional length modifier.
